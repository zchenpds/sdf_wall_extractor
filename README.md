# sdf_wall_extractor
Extracts the wall links and write them in an xml format for pedsim_ros to use.

## Introduction
[SDF](http://sdformat.org/) is an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot simulators, visualization, and control. It can be easily generated by Gazebo. [pedsim_ros](https://github.com/zchenpds/pedsim_ros) is a ROS-based pedestrian dynamics simulator whose scene files are specified in a different dialet of XML format. To enable the xdf files to be used by pedsim_ros, this program extracts the wall links from an sdf file and write them in a form like that shown in [sdf.xml](https://github.com/zchenpds/sdf_wall_extractor/blob/master/sdf.xml), which conforms to the scene file format used by pedsim_ros.

## Requirements
* tinyxml2 (already included in this repo)
* Qt 4

## How to use
1. Change the filePath in the main function of the main.cpp file to specify the location of the sdf file to be exported. An example sdf file is provided.
1. Copy the content of generated xml file into an intended xml file to be used by pedsim_ros.
